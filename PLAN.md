# Plan for `slackfs`

## High-Level Goals

I want to create a novelty but fully usable Slack client that mounts Slack as a filesystem.  
The idea is that standard shell commands (`echo`, `tail -f`, etc.) become the way to interact with Slack.

**Core goals:**
- Treat Slack workspaces and channels as directories and files.
- Be able to send messages by appending to a file (`echo ... >> channel`).
- Be able to follow live channel activity using `tail -f channel`.
- Support Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Provide a "native" experience via FUSE on each OS.
- Provide a packaged fallback VM (tiny Linux inside QEMU) for users who cannot or do not want to install FUSE drivers.
- Make it hackable and fun for other developers to try.

---

## Ideal Result (Examples)

```bash
# Send a message to #general
echo "hello world" >> ~/slackfs/#general.txt

# Send a message to a private channel
echo "status update: deployed" >> ~/slackfs/private-team-chat.txt

# Follow messages in #general live
tail -f ~/slackfs/#general.txt

# Same but get raw JSON for each Slack event
tail -f ~/slackfs/#general.json
```

When I type these commands:
	•	The message goes into Slack in real time.
	•	Tailing shows other people’s messages as they arrive, with no polling visible to the user.
	•	Different extensions (.txt, .json, etc.) allow for different views (human-readable vs structured).

Desired OS Support

Primary:
	•	Linux: libfuse (native support).
	•	macOS: macFUSE (installable kernel extension).
	•	Windows: WinFsp (Windows FUSE-compatible layer).

Fallback / VM:
	•	Ship a tiny QEMU-based Linux VM with:
	•	BusyBox, Bash, slackfs binary, FUSE support.
	•	A simple launcher script per platform to start it and give users a shell.
	•	Purpose: if macFUSE/WinFsp is too hard to set up, users can still run slackfs inside a Linux VM shell.

Implementation Plan

Language & Libraries
	•	Go chosen for developer speed, good concurrency model, and cross-platform compilation.
	•	FUSE: bazil.org/fuse for FUSE filesystem implementation.
	•	Slack API: slack-go/slack for Slack client integration.

Authentication
	•	User must provide a Slack token (xoxp-***).
	•	For now: read from SLACK_TOKEN environment variable.
	•	Later: build helper flow (Node/Bun CLI or Go-based OAuth helper).

Filesystem Design
	•	Mount point shows Slack workspace as root directory.
	•	Each channel is represented as one or more files:
	•	#channel.txt → plain text messages.
	•	#channel.json → raw JSON message events.
	•	Writing to #channel.txt with O_APPEND translates to chat.postMessage.
	•	Tailing #channel.txt streams messages as they arrive from Slack’s Socket Mode.

Message Handling
	•	Outgoing: implement Write in FUSE handler. On echo >> file, parse input line(s), send to Slack API.
	•	Incoming: use Slack Socket Mode to subscribe to new messages. On new message, append to in-memory buffer and notify kernel via FUSE invalidate APIs so tail -f readers see the update.
	•	Maintain rate limiting and backoff according to Slack API rules.

Native Installation
	•	Linux: build native binary, require libfuse installed.
	•	macOS: build native binary, require macFUSE (user must install).
	•	Windows: build native binary, require WinFsp.

VM Fallback
	•	Build a minimal Linux image (Alpine-based).
	•	Include slackfs binary, BusyBox, Bash.
	•	Package with QEMU and launcher script:
	•	macOS: ./slackfs-vm.sh opens a terminal into the VM.
	•	Windows: .bat or PowerShell equivalent.
	•	Linux: optional, for users who don’t have libfuse.
	•	UX: user operates Slack from inside the VM shell using standard Linux tools.

Roadmap
	1.	Skeleton FS
	•	Mount a FUSE fs, expose one dummy file hello.txt.
	•	Verify cat and tail -f work.
	2.	Slack integration
	•	Read SLACK_TOKEN from env.
	•	Send message on echo >> file.
	•	Display Slack messages in tail -f.
	3.	Channel mapping
	•	List channels as files under mount point.
	•	Support .txt and .json.
	4.	Cross-platform testing
	•	Linux dev box.
	•	macOS with macFUSE.
	•	Windows with WinFsp.
	5.	VM fallback
	•	Package Alpine/QEMU image.
	•	Provide launcher scripts for macOS/Windows/Linux.
	6.	Polish
	•	Handle Slack rate limits.
	•	Provide CLI for login/token management.
	•	Document installation steps for each platform.

⸻

Stretch Ideas
	•	Directories for threads (#channel/ts1234.txt).
	•	Represent DMs as files.
	•	Support grep across all channels.
	•	Alternate output formats (.html, .md).
	•	Multi-workspace mounting.

⸻

Success Criteria
	•	I can run:

echo "it works" >> ~/slackfs/#general.txt
tail -f ~/slackfs/#general.txt


	•	Message appears in Slack #general, and I see new messages in real time with tail -f.
	•	Works on at least Linux + macOS.
	•	Windows users can either install WinFsp or fall back to the VM bundle.
